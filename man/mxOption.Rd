\title{Set or Clear an OpenMx Option}

\description{
The function sets, shows, or clears an option that is specific to OpenMx's backend.  For global \R \link[base:options]{options} that affect OpenMx's frontend, please refer to the "See Also" section below.
}

\usage{
mxOption(model=NULL, key=NULL, value, reset = FALSE)
}

\arguments{
\item{model}{An \link{MxModel} object or NULL}
\item{key}{The name of the option.}
\item{value}{The value of the option.}
\item{reset}{If TRUE then reset all options to their defaults.}
}

\details{
mxOption is used to set, clear, or query an option (given in the \sQuote{key} argument)
pertaining to the backend. Valid option keys are listed below.

Use value = NULL to remove an existing option. Leaving value blank will return
the current value of the option specified by \sQuote{key}.

To reset all options to their default values, use \sQuote{reset = TRUE}.
When reset = TRUE, \sQuote{key} and \sQuote{value} are ignored.

If the \sQuote{model} argument is set to NULL, the option will be set globally (i.e
applying to all models by default).

To see the current values of the global options, use \code{getOption('mxOptions')}.

Before the model is submitted to the backend, all keys and values are converted into
strings using the \link{as.character} function.

\strong{Optimizer specific options}

The \dQuote{Default optimizer} option can only be set globally (i.e., with \code{model=NULL}), and not locally (i.e., specifically to a given MxModel).  Although the checkpointing options may be set globally, OpenMx's behavior is only affected by locally set checkpointing options (that is, global checkpointing options are ignored at \link[=mxRun]{runtime}).

Gradient-based optimizers require the gradient of the fit
function. When analytic derivatives are not available,
the gradient is estimated numerically. There are a variety
of options to control the numerical estimation of the
gradient. One option for CSOLNP and SLSQP is
the gradient algorithm. CSOLNP uses the \code{forward} method
by default, while SLSQP uses the \code{central} method. The
\code{forward} method requires 1 times \dQuote{Gradient iterations}
function evaluation per parameter
per gradient, while \code{central} method requires 2 times
\dQuote{Gradient iterations} function evaluations per parameter
per gradient. Users can change the default methods for either of these
optimizers by setting the \dQuote{Gradient algorithm} option.
NPSOL usually uses the \code{forward} method, but
adaptively switches to \code{central} under certain circumstances.

Options \dQuote{Gradient step size}, \dQuote{Gradient iterations}, and \dQuote{Function precision} have on-load global defaults of \code{"Auto"}.  If value \code{"Auto"} is in effect for any of these three options at \link[=mxRun]{runtime}, then OpenMx selects a reasonable numerical value in its place.  These automated numerical values are intended to (1) adjust for the limited precision of the algorithm for computing multivariate-normal probability integrals, and (2) calculate accurate numeric derivatives at the optimizer's solution.  If the user replaces \code{"Auto"} with a valid numerical value, then OpenMx uses that value as-is.

By default, CSOLNP uses a step size of 10^-7 whereas SLSQP uses
10^-5. The purpose of this difference is to obtain roughly the same
accuracy given other differences in numerical procedure.
If you set a non-default \dQuote{Gradient step size},
it will be used as-is. NPSOL ignores
\dQuote{Gradient step size}, and instead uses a function of
\link{mxOption} \dQuote{Function precision} to determine its gradient
step size.

Some options only affect certain optimizers. Option \dQuote{Gradient algorithm} is used by CSOLNP and SLSQP, and ignored by NPSOL. Option \dQuote{Gradient iterations} only affects SLSQP. Option \dQuote{Gradient step size} is used slightly differently by SLSQP and CSOLNP, and is ignored by NPSOL (see \code{\link{mxComputeGradientDescent}()} for details).

If an mxModel contains \link[=MxConstraint]{mxConstraints}, NPSOL is given .4 times the value of the option \dQuote{Feasibility tolerance}. If there are no constraints, NPSOL is given a hard-coded value of 1e-5 (its own native default).

\emph{Note}: Where constraints are present, NPSOL is given 0.4 times the value of the mxOption \dQuote{Feasibility Tolerance}, and this is about a million times bigger than NPSOL's own native default. Values of \dQuote{Feasibility Tolerance} around 1e-5 may be needed to get constraint performance similar to NPSOL's default. Note also that NPSOL's criterion for returning a status code of 0 versus 1 for a given solution depends partly on \dQuote{Optimality tolerance}.

For a block of \code{n} ordinal variables, the maximum number of integration points that OpenMx may use to calculate multivariate-normal probability integrals is given by
\code{mvnMaxPointsA + mvnMaxPointsB*n + mvnMaxPointsC*n*n +
  exp(mvnMaxPointsD + mvnMaxPointsE * n * log(mvnRelEps))}.
Integral approximation is stopped once either \sQuote{mvnAbsEps} or
\sQuote{mvnRelEps} is satisfied.
Use of \sQuote{mvnAbsEps} is deprecated.

The maximum number of major iterations (the option  \dQuote{Major iterations})
for optimization for NPSOL  can be specified either by using a
numeric value (such as 50, 1000, etc) or by specifying a user-defined function.
The user-defined function should accept two arguments as input, the number of
parameters and the number of constraints, and return a numeric value as output.

\seealso{
See \code{\link{mxModel}()}, as almost all uses of \code{mxOption()} are via an mxModel whose options are set or cleared.  See \code{\link{mxComputeGradientDescent}()} for details on how different optimizers are affected by different options. See \link{as.statusCode} for information about the \code{Status OK} option.

The OpenMx frontend is affected by five global \R \link[base:options]{options}.  For option "mxDefaultType", see \code{\link[=mxModel]{mxModel}()}.  For options "mxByrow" and "mxCondenseMatrixSlots", see \code{\link[=mxMatrix]{mxMatrix}()}.  Option "evalMxObjectAlgebraEnv" governs the behavior of two internal OpenMx functions--\code{evaluateMxObject()} and \code{evaluateAlgebraWithContext()}--and is primarily of interest to third-party package developers.  Option "swift.initialexpr" is for developer use when testing OpenMx on a computing cluster.
