umx 2.3.1
--------------

* To Be Updated


umx 2.2.6
--------------

* Available on CRAN.
* New optimizer: SLSQP
* New data and model types: WLS, LISREL, GREML
* Additional helpers:
* mxMI() Modification indicies for any single-group likelihood-based model.
* mxGenerateData() Generate data based on a single-group RAM, LISREL, Normal, or State Space model.
* mxGetExpected() Get the expected means, covariance, or thresholds from a RAM, LISREL, or Normal model.
* mxCheckIdentification() Check the identification of single or multigroup, RAM, LISREL, Normal, or State Space model.
* omxRMSEA() Get the RMSEA with confidence interval and test of approximate fit. Also, reported in mxSummary.
* mxKalmanScores() Get the Kalman latent state scores from a state space model. It can also be adapted for non-ordinal factor scores.
* mxFactorScores() Estimate latent variable scores from a LISREL factor model via several methods including maximum likelihood and for ordinal data.
* mxAlgebraFromString() Construct an mxAlgebra from an R expression provided as a character string.
* mxFitFunctionMultigroup() used to require "modelname.fitfunction", : now "modelname" will work too.
* Definition variables work correctly with mxFitFunctionRow().
* Confidence intervals are improved:
* parameter vector at each confidence limit ("bound") is now available in mxSummary(verbose=T).
* Improvements to CSOLNP. Note that CSOLNP should still be used with caution
* mxExpectationStateSpaceContinuousTime()
* Improvements to mxTryHard().
* Improvements to the internal interface with NPSOL:
* Further improvements to WLS are expected in subsequent releases.
